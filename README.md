# PSO
Implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization method.

The single particle is described by the class Particle in the particle.py file.
The algorithm of the Particle Swarm Optimization is implemented in the PSO.ipynb file. To use it, you have simply to call the function PSO from the PSO.ipynb file. 
An example of how to use it can be found in the file : - CNN_with_PSO.ipynb and - MLP_with_PSO.ipynb
